## Objective
To make a GUI Based Rock Paper Scissors game with 

HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Approach
I chose it to keep it simple and intuitive, click play and replay.

## Difficulties And Learning
The Approach i chose to do this things, made to me to manipulate the dom structure
multiple time, so as i move forward with the progress.

i was not satisfied with the constant removal and addition of element which led me into making custom function to just create and add elements to the dom and a custom event to add attribute to DOM elements

although this a huge time taken for doing this simple project this really reinforced the idea of DOM very clearly.
